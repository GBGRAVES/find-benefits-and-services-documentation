The product includes several features in service of the product goal: to help Veterans and their families find relevant benefits and confidently take the next steps. Feature development is informed by research and iterated through testing and design insights.

The product features can be divided into three elements: the guided experience, the benefits directory, and information for next steps.

---

### The guided experience

When users first arrive on the product, they need some simple guidance to find their relevant benefits so that they’re not overwhelmed with information. This experience guides the user through a series of questions to narrow down which benefits meet their needs depending on who is receiving the benefit, the Veteran’s service type and service status, if the Veteran has a service-related health issue, and the selected benefit categories.

### Benefits directory

**Filtering benefits by category**

Each benefit has been assigned to a category, i.e. emergency funds, medical assistance, or elder care. Users are shown which categories are available and can filter benefits by category to more quickly find ones that meet their needs.

**Searching benefits by name or description**

Users can search for benefits from the homepage or from within the benefits directory. Veterans or family members can quickly surface the benefit that meets their need.

**Sorting benefits by popularity**

The benefits list is sorted by popularity by default. With the most popular benefits on top, most users don’t need to wade through the entire list to find what they need.

**Saving relevant benefits**

Without logging in, Veterans and their families can curate a list of relevant benefits to save for later or send to a friend.

**Discovering associated benefits**

Most benefits have an associated benefit; if you are eligible for one , you are automatically eligible for another. Associated benefits are listed together, so that users don’t have to make the connection between the two themselves.

### Next steps

**Printing saved benefits**

Many Veterans go in-person to VAC area offices and having a printed list of relevant benefits jump-starts their conversation with VAC frontline staff. The printed list includes selected filters, the saved benefits, and relevant information for contacting the area offices.

**Locating a VAC area office**

Veterans and their families can locate the closest VAC area office on a map and get directions.
