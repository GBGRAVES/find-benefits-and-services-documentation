### UX Principles

Three user experience principles emerged from user research and guided the product's design decisions and development:

**Guidance**

Guide users through the abundance of information and lead them through the information that is only relevant to them as an individual.

**Simplicity**

Show information only when it is important at that moment to not overwhelm users.

**Transparency**

Be open and honest with the information and the process users have to go through to complete their goals.

## Usability testing

CDS conducted usability testing with current serving military members, medically released and retired Veterans, VAC frontline staff, Veteransâ€™ family members, and representative users with unique needs.  There were four rounds of testing with fourteen participants total, focusing on product navigation, benefit filters, data mapping, and parent/child benefit relationships.  

Data collection from every round of usability testing goes through analysis and results in insights. Insights inform the design decisions that are made on the application. Those decisions are tested in the next round to ensure the product is heading in the right direction and that the metrics collected in previous rounds improve. Each design and product change were informed by design insights which are catalogued in a [Design Decision Log](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12MvxpyNrzi64RBuz_F7oAVRQhPVtcOmskT5BPuZZj3c/edit#slide=id.p1).
